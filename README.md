An exaustive color manipulation library in Vanilla JS

NB: The library still under developpement, pleass wait about a version i could be proud to share with you :').

TODO (Milestones)
-----------------

v1 : Get a js object about all the different kind of color representations (RGB, RGBA, HEX, etc.) and provide functions to translate one into another.

v2 : Provide a full solution about colors (find nearest color, further, determinist color, etc.)

v3 : Add gradient managements

v4 : Add Filter managements (complementaty, sepia, colorblind)

v5 : Add debug utilities functions (in particular be able to "draw" the gradient, the operations realized by filters, etc).


Post Scriptum
-------------

Even if i'm developper, I'm not a mathematician. If you see a way to get more accurate results or want to add others color reprensations feel free to fork ! I want to made the most trustable js library about color convertion so all help will be apreciated.
